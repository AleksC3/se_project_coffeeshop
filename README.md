# Project 2 Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. It was designed to assist users in reserving a table at the coffee shop. There is also a menu and some information about our coffee shop.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I feel that adding images of the items in the bakery would be an improvement
